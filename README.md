# LOLStore
This website is to promote and provide "League of Legends" Products to customers as well as some information about the game.
 
## Design Process
I wanted to design this page to help users to have a easier way to 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
